## Notes

For me the initial tutorial on how to build the bare bones app was great, but it was tricky to figure out how to add additional features without having a deep understanding of how xcode or swift works. I found myself getting lost in all the different views of xcode and was overwhelmed at times by the number of options or things you could tweak. I figure this is just the learning process of getting used to a new skill.
